# Metastatic Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning with PyTorch and computer vision techniques to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans. It leverages pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to enhance model performance.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a model to identify metastatic cancer using the Positive Cell Adenocarcinoma Margin (PCAM) dataset.
- **Techniques**: CNNs, transfer learning, data augmentation.
- **Framework**: PyTorch.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading, augmenting, and normalizing the PCAM dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Using pre-trained CNN models with transfer learning.
3. **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and accuracy improvements.

## Requirements

- Basic Python and machine learning knowledge.
- Jupyter Notebook and required libraries.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrkshreyash/cancer-image-detection-pytorch.git
    ```
2. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Cancer_Image_Detection_With_PyTorch.ipynb
    ```

## Dataset

Ensure the PCAM dataset is available in the specified directory before running the notebook.
